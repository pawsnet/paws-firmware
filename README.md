Firmware addition to BISmark for use in PAWS deployment

/www - this re-implements the /www directory in the BISmark firmware. This provides a webUI at http://192.168.142.1/ which is specific to PAWS project, replacing the previous webUI on the router which was specific to BISmark. Until a better method is avalaible to add use the PAWS webUI, replace the /www directory in BISmark firmware with this /www directory and reboot the router
